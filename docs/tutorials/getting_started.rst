Getting Started
=====================

There are a few concepts that almost every OSL script will reqiure.
Before anything else, we suggest going through the following basic tutorials:

- :ref:`adding_joints_tutorial`
- :ref:`adding_loadcell_tutorial`
- :ref:`reading_from_sensors_tutorial`
- :ref:`using_osl_clock_tutorial`
- :ref:`commanding_current_tutorial`

Once you're comfortable with these, you should be ready to tackle the rest of the Tutorials and the Examples.
