Commanding Impedance
====================

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to use the ``opensourceleg`` library to control the impedance of a joint.

Import the OpenSourceLeg Class
------------------------------

To use the ``OpenSourceLeg`` class, we first need to import it from the ``opensourceleg.osl`` module:

.. code-block:: python

    from opensourceleg.osl import OpenSourceLeg

Add a Joint Object
-------------------

Once we have imported the ``OpenSourceLeg`` class, we can create an instance of the class with the desired frequency and joint configuration:

.. code-block:: python

    osl = OpenSourceLeg(frequency=200)  # 200 Hz
    osl.add_joint(gear_ratio=9.0)

Controlling Joint Impedance
---------------------------

To control the impedance of a joint, we can use a ``with`` block to ensure that the ``OpenSourceLeg`` object is properly opened and cleaned up after use:

.. code-block:: python

    test_stiffness_value = 20  # Nm/rad
    test_damping_value = 20  # Nm/rad/s
    set_point = 50  # motor ticks

    with osl:
        osl.knee.set_mode(osl.knee.control_modes.impedance)
        osl.knee.set_joint_impedance(K=test_stiffness_value, B=test_damping_value)
        osl.knee.set_motor_position(osl.knee.motor_position + set_point)
        
        for t in osl.clock:
            osl.log.info(osl.knee.motor_position)
            osl.update()

In this code, we enter a ``with`` block that sets the mode of the ``knee`` joint to `impedance` and set the motor position of the ``knee`` joint to the current position plus a set point of 50 degrees. We then set the impedance of the ``knee`` joint using the ``set_joint_impedance`` method, with a stiffness of 20 Nm/rad and a damping of 20 Nm/rad/s. We then loop over the ``osl.clock`` generator, which generates a sequence of timestamps at the specified frequency, and log the motor position of the ``knee`` joint to the console at each timestamp. We then call the ``osl.update`` method to update the state of the ``OpenSourceLeg`` object.

.. Note::
    When setting the impedance gains, we can also use the ``set_motor_impedance`` method to set the impedance of the motor instead of the joint. The difference between the two methods is that the ``set_joint_impedance`` method first divides the initial value by the gear ratio squared then sets the gains, while the ``set_motor_impedance`` method simply sets the gains. The impedance of the joint is the impedance of the motor plus the impedance of the joint.

.. Note::
    We can also set the gains directly using "convert" methods. We can set the impedance gains using the ``set_impedance_gains`` method and the ``convert_to_joint_impedance`` method for joint stiffness and damping using real units. Alternatively, we can set impedance gains using the ``set_impedance_gains`` method and the ``convert_to_motor_impedance`` method for setting the motor stiffness and damping values with real units. Finally, we can set the impedance gains using the ``set_impedance_gains`` method and the ``convert_to_pid_impedance`` method for setting the motor sitffness and damping using the built-in PID controller.

.. Warning::
    This code assumes that the ``OpenSourceLeg`` object is properly configured and calibrated, and that the joint is properly connected and functioning.
